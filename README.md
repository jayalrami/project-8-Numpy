# NumPy Analyzer

A **menu-driven Python application** that demonstrates core **NumPy** operations such as array creation, indexing & slicing, mathematical operations, combining & splitting arrays, searching, sorting, filtering, and statistical analysis.

This project is ideal for **students and beginners** learning NumPy through hands-on practice.

## 📌 Features

### 1. Array Creation

* Create **1D**, **2D**, or **3D** NumPy arrays using user input
* Automatic reshaping based on dimensions

### 2. Indexing & Slicing

* Access specific elements using indexing
* Slice 2D arrays by row and column ranges

### 3. Mathematical Operations

* Element-wise:

  * Addition
  * Subtraction
  * Multiplication
  * Division
* Dot Product using `np.dot()`

### 4. Combine & Split Arrays

* Combine arrays using **vertical stacking** (`np.vstack`)
* Split arrays into multiple parts using `np.array_split`

### 5. Search, Sort & Filter

* Search for a value in the array
* Sort array elements
* Filter elements based on conditions

### 6. Aggregates, Statistics & Correlation

* Sum
* Mean
* Median
* Standard Deviation
* Variance
* Minimum & Maximum
* Percentile
* Correlation Coefficient (`np.corrcoef`)
